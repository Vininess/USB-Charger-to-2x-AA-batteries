### USB Power Charger
- **out-:** System Ground (To Voltage Regulator **_G_**)
- **B-:** Battery - (Minus)
- **_Blank_:** Battery + (Plus)
- **+:** Voltage Output (To Voltage Regulator **_V<sub>I</sub>_**)
### Voltage Regulator
- **V<sub>i</sub>:** Voltage Input (To USB Power Charger **_+ (Plus)_** _(which is 3.7v)_)
- **G:** System Ground (To USB Power Charger **_OUT_** & 2x AA battery **_- (Minus)_**)
- **V<sub>o</sub>:** Voltage Output (To 2x AA battery **_+ (Plus)_** _(which is 3v)_)
### 3.7v Lithium Battery
- **Size:** The only thumb rule is one that fits inside the device
- **mAh:** Determines how long the device will work, the higher the value, the longer it is on
- **3.7V:** Operating voltage, must always be 3.7v
- **+ _(Plus)_:** Battery Voltage (To USB Power Charger **_Blank_**)
- **- _(Minus)_:** Battery Ground (To USB Power Charger **_B-_**)

## Operations
- **RED Light:** Charging the battery
- **BLUE Light:** Fully Charged

## _CAUTION_
- Avoid overheating the battery terminals for a long time, as it may explode
- Avoid turning on the system while it is charging, as it never finishes charging.
