# Voltage Regulator
To regulate the voltage from 3.7v (battery voltage) to a clean and stable output of 3v which is the voltage of 2x AA batteries, we will use the [**ME6206A/30**](https://datasheetspdf.com/mobile/640248/Microne/ME6206A/1)

## Considerations
- Due to the very low cost, it is interesting to get a ready-made board instead of designing one.

## PINS
- **V<sub>i</sub>:** Voltage Input (To USB Power Charger **_+ (Plus)_** _(which is 3.7v)_)
- **G:** System Ground (To USB Power Charger **_OUT_**)
- **V<sub>o</sub>:** Voltage Output (To 2x AA battery connectors _(which is 3v)_)
