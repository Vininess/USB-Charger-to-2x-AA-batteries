# USB-Charger-to-2x-AA-batteries
A 3.7v lithum battery system to replace the use of 2x AA batteries, with a fixed and stable 3v voltage for primary use in GB/GBC/GBA but can be used in any system that uses 2x AA batteries

There are mods for replacing the 2x AA batteries in the Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advanced.

The problem is that some mods use a diode to regulate the system's output voltage, but the diode is unstable, as the voltage drop varies according to the inverse of the temperature (The higher the heat, the lower the voltage drop)

The aim of this project is to present a simple and clean solution for regulating the output voltage of these mods and present other features
